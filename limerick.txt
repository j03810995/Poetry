Examples of Limericks in Poetry [AABBA]

There was an Old Man with a beard, 
Who said, 'It is just as I feared! 
Two Owls and a Hen, 
Four Larks and a Wren, 
Have all built their nests in my beard!


There was a middle-aged coder who was as if he didn't know who to be,
Stubbornly he wanted to fiddle about with C,
The man saw his own reflection and removed his balaclava,
After which he started programming in Java,
The process took him 20 long and wasted years, it didn't happen all so suddenly!
